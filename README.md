#  Account Payment Management (LWC Project)

---

## 🧭 Overview
This project was developed to centrally manage and visualize payment risks by account within our organization using the **Lightning Web Component (LWC)**, **Apex**, and **custom objects**.  
The solution allows users to select an account, view existing payments for that account, and quickly create new payment records from the same interface.

## 🔗 Master-Detail vs Lookup Relationship Choice

**Chosen Relationship:** Master-Detail relationship  

**Reason of choosing this relationship:**  
The Master-Detail relationship is used to establish a tight dependency between one object (Detail) and another (Master). I chose this relationship because a payment record (Payment__c) cannot be considered a logical entity without an Account, and the Payment record must be linked to the Account. Two critical features of Master-Detail support this project: First, for data integrity, when the Master record is deleted, Detail records are automatically deleted (cascade delete). Second, and most importantly, for financial analysis, it provides the ability to create Roll-Up Summary Fields on the Master object that sum, count, or average the Detail object's fields. This capability is essential for the primary output of our project, the visualization of the total financial risk (Sum of Amount) by Account on the Dashboard.
